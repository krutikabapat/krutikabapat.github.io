In this blog post we will be learning about Generative and Discriminiative models. Suppose that we have one model which can
learn things in-depth and throughly and we have another model which can learn to identify only the differences between the 
things it sees.

In technical terms, a Generative model learns the joint probability distribution p(x,y) and a Discriminative model learns the 
conditional probability distribution p(x|y) using Bayes theorem. For example, if you have input data x and you want to classify
it into y labels. The geneartive models learn the joint probability distribution p(x,y) and a discriminative model basically learns
the conditional probability distribution p(y|x).

Some of the examples of Generative classifiers are:-
1. Na√Øve Bayes
2. Hidden Markov Models (HMM)
3. Markov random fields

Some of the examples of Discriminative Classifiers are:-
1. Conditional Random Fields (CRF)s
2. Logistic regression
3. Traditional neural networks
4. Nearest neighbour
