In this blog post we will be learning about Generative and Discriminiative models. Suppose that we have one model which can
learn things in-depth and throughly, and we have another model which can learn to identify only the differences between the 
things it sees.

In technical terms, a Genrative model learns the joint probability distribution p(x,y) and a Discriminative model learns the 
conditional probability distribution p(x|y) using Byes theorem.
