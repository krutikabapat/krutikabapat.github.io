In this blog post we will learn about CUDA programming, difference between C and CUDA programming and how it is efficient. Generally these days laptop and computers have shared CPUs and GPUs in-built, but we will learn how to use Google Colabs for CUDA programming.  

## What is CUDA?  

CUDA is NVIDIA's parallel computing architecture that enables increase in computing performance by utilizing the power of GPU (Graphical Processing Unit). CUDA provides C/C++ language extension for programming and managing GPUs.
