Projects on Jupyter Notebook
====================

<a href="https://github.com/krutikabapat/Tensorflow_basics" target="_blank">**Tensorflow Programs and Tutorials**</a> - This Github repo contains multiple iPython notebooks which serve as tutorials for learning about deploying deep learning and machine learning models. The following topics are covered. 
- **Inverse Cooking: Recipe Generation from Food Images**: This notebook shows you how to generate the recipe from a given food Image. This work has been recently published in CVPR-2019 (June) (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.06164.pdf). The whole workflow is implemented in Pytorch.  

- **Video Panorama**: This notebook shows you how to how to generate a panorama from a video which is captured already.
It has been implemented both in Python and cpp using OpenCV. Example video is of a mountain area, and the result image is the panorama of the whole view captured in the video.  
- **Crowd Counting**: This notebook looks at a recent [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.10062.pdf) that is based on dilated convolutions to generate feature maps for the images of the crowd and find the number of people in the crowd.The network was detects the crowd with an accuracy of 94%.  
- **Video Stabilization**: This notebook focuses on stabilizing a video, which has random motions, specificaaly due to capturing of video while standing through mobile phone. After performing video stabilization, the video has o external motions. The implementation is both in Python and cpp.  
- **And more!**

OpenCV based Projects
====================

- **Shape Matching**: This majorly focuses on matching the shapes in a given image, locate and detect them. Various parameters in the function can be modified to get the results accordingly.  
 

React Web Apps
====================

<a href="https://mlb-stats-app.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">**MLB Stats App**</a> - First web application using the React JS framework. Have been hearing a lot of good things about it, so I wanted to give it a shot. This app is pretty simple. It just displays the 2016 regular season stats for each MLB team. Looking to add more functionality and iron out a few of the bugs a little later. 

Kaggle Competitions
====================

<a href="https://github.com/adeshpande3/KaggleTitanic" target="_blank">**Kaggle Titanic**</a> - The Kaggle Titanic competition revolved around taking in a dataset of all the passengers in the Titanic, and then predicting whether or not they survived. The features in the dataset included room location, age, gender, etc. For this competition, I used a variety of different supervised learning approaches (SVMs, KNNs, Decision Trees, Neural Networks), but ultimately found that a KNN model (where K = 17) got the best accuracy of 78.95%. I used Numpy and Sklearn to help preprocess the data and create the models. 
<br><br><a href="https://github.com/adeshpande3/Kaggle-MNIST" target="_blank">**Kaggle MNIST**</a> - The Kaggle MNIST competiiton is a quite standard benchmark for all computer vision models. MNIST is a dataset of handwritten digits, and the overall goal is to have the model classify each image as a digit from 0-9. For this competition, I used a convolutional neural network written in Keras. The model gets an accuracy of 98.63%.
<br><br><a href="https://github.com/adeshpande3/KaggleGhosts" target="_blank">**Kaggle Ghosts**</a> - This playground competition was a little different in that it involved a "fake" dataset and task. The goal was to take in features of different fantasy monsters (Ghoust, Ghool, or Goblin), and output the most likely classification. Some of the features included hair length, bone length and color. An SVM proved to work the best as I was able to achieve a 73.54% accuracy. I used Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to help visualize the data and features. 

Other Tutorials
====================

<a href="https://github.com/adeshpande3/Pandas-Tutorial/blob/master/Pandas%20Tutorial.ipynb" target="_blank">**Pandas Tutorial**</a> - Pandas is the one of the most popular Python libraries as it can be lots for a variety of different data sience tasks. From describing data structures to introducing the most important functions, this tutorial is a great starting point for anyone looking to start using Pandas.
